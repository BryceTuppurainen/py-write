    "description": "Py-Write is a simple web application that I have been experimenting with to enable for automatic scraping of raw GitHub content or raw UTF text content delivered from a .pywr file onto a Raspberry Pi Pico running a Micropython REPL, I decided to make publicly available so anyone in the community can modify this. I don't intend to keep this as a maintained project, but if you have any questions please shoot me a message on the GitHub repository and I'll see what I can do to help!"
